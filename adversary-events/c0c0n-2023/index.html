            Adversary Simulator booth will have hands-on adversary emulation plans specific to a wide variety of
            threat-actors - ransomware, these are meant to provide the participant/visitor with a better understanding
            of the Adversary tactics. This is a volunteer assisted activity where anyone, both management and technical
            folks can come-in and experience different categories of simulation, emulation and purple scenarios.
            Adversary Simulator booth will be having a lab environment focused on recreating enterprise infrastructure,
            aimed at simulating and emulating various adversaries. The booth visitors will be able to view, simulate and
            control various TTPs used by adversaries. The simulator is meant to be a learning experience, irrespective
            of whether one is hands-on with highly sophisticated attack tactics or from the management.

            <h4 style="color: rgb(81, 67, 168);"> Scavenger Hunt </h4>
            A scavenger hunt is a game or activity in which participants are given a list of items, clues, or tasks to
            find or complete within a specified area or time frame. Participants work individually or in teams to locate
            the items or solve the clues, often racing against each other. The goal is to be the first to complete the
            list or tasks or to accumulate the most points. This Scavenger hunt takes place at the c0c0n venue using the
            components available at the conferencearea.

               <p>In the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), there are
                  myriad concepts and considerations to explore.
                  The talk delves into the core foundations and critical aspects of AI/ML systems. We will begin by
                  unraveling the basics of AI/ML,
                  shedding light on the fundamental principles that underpin intelligent computer systems. From
                  understanding the essence of AI to the practical
                  implications of machine learning, we'll demystify these technologies. </br>
                  Large Language Models (LLMs) have become prominent players in AI, but what exactly are they? and what
                  they are not, debunking common misconceptions.
                  You'll gain insight into the lifeline of a query and discover more about Tuning LLM(s), how they
                  process etc. </br>
                  We'll delve into potential attack types, emphasizing the importance of safety and effectiveness in AI
                  systems. Addressing data privacy concerns,
                  input-related attacks, isolation strategies, and security of training data and models along with
                  strategies to safeguard the training data. </p>

                     This workshop is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills needed to
                     establish and enhance a robust cybersecurity defense strategy. Adversary Simulation and Purple
                     Teaming
                     are critical components of modern cybersecurity, focusing on proactive testing and collaboration
                     between
                     offensive and defensive teams.
                     In this workshop, attendees will learn the fundamentals of Adversary Simulation, where they will
                     explore
                     the methodologies and tools used by threat actors to simulate real-world attacks on their
                     organization's
                     infrastructure. Participants will gain hands-on experience in running controlled simulations,
                     identifying
                     vulnerabilities, and assessing the organization's resilience against potential cyber threats.
                     The workshop will also delve into the concept of Purple Teaming, emphasizing the collaborative
                     approach
                     between Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) to strengthen security measures. Attendees
                     will
                     discover how to foster communication and cooperation between teams, enabling them to learn from
                     each
                     other and improve their overall cybersecurity posture. <br>
