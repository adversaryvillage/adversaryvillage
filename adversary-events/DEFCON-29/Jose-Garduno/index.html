               <h3>Talk: C2Centipede: APT level C2 communications for common reverse HTTP shell
                  tools.
               </h3>
               <p>
                  Adversaries have been continuously improving their malware to
                  be stealthier and more resilient on both the victim’s host as well as on the network.Examples of these innovations on the latter include Fast Flux networks, Domain Generation
                  Algorithms and Domain Fronting among other techniques.
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately, open source tools for threat emulation currently have limited support for
                  such advanced features, leaving redteams with easy to detect C2 communications. We
                  present C2Centipede, a proxy tool that provides these features to HTTP reverse shell tools
                  (like Metasploit or Empire) to be stealthier on the network by dynamically and transparently
                  modifying the trojan’s C2 communication routing and beaconing strategies, with the aim of
                  evading some of the blueteam’s detection strategies.
               </p>
               <h6>Beaconing Evasion</h6>
               <p>
                  Detection of HTTP reverse shell beaconing activity is possible because most of the patterns
                  on which malware sends the beacons through the network can be identified as they occur in
                  static time intervals or are adjusted in specific increments, attributes which are possible to
                  detect using statistical analysis.[1]
               </p>
               <p>For instance, Metasploit’s reverse_http meterpreter sends a message to the C2 server every
                  100 milliseconds and increases the interval by this same measure each time the C2 server
                  gives no new jobs to the trojan, up to a maximum of 10 seconds.[2]
               </p>
               <p>It is easy then for tools like RITA to perform statistical analysis on the number, timing and
                  size of connections between pairs of hosts (source, destination)[3]. This IP-pair evaluation
                  works in the most typical approach of having only one IP per C2 server. We implement a
                  beaconing detection evasion method that works by 1) Altering the trojan’s C2
                  communication message interval and 2) Splitting and routing the C2 communication among
                  many C2 server addresses to hide beaconing and exfiltration.
               </p>
               <h6>Jitter Modification</h6>
               <p>The Achille’s heel of most RAT (Remote Access Trojan) and TES (Threat Emulation Software)
                  tools network stealthiness is fixed beaconing intervals. The time interval between each
                  message that goes to the C2 server is usually hardcoded and just too short, making manyrequests across the network, so we have incorporated in the tool, better control of the
                  beaconing, with the possibility of modifying the jitter on the fly or having preset
                  configurations, like allowing C2 communication just on certain time window.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Some RAT/TES tools will fail after a specific amount of unsuccessful C2 communication
                  attempts, so the C2Centipede proxy client cannot just drop the HTTP calls that don’t fit the
                  operator’s beaconing strategy, therefore fake C2 response messages are generated in order
                  to keep the trojan alive.
               </p>
               <h6>Faux Flux</h6>
               <p>The concept of Fast Flux networks as a technique to improve a botnet’s C2 availability has
                  been in use since 2007-2008.[4] Using this technique, an attacker can hide the real C2 server
                  behind proxies (which are usually compromised edge servers in a botnet), and distributing
                  said proxies IPs through DNS records with a very low TTL[5], allowing them to rapidly (and
                  thus the name fast flux) change the resolved IP for a given domain name. This results in
                  making the shutdown of each C2 IP so difficult as to be usually compared to a whack a mole
                  game.[4] The weakness of this approach is the reliance on a domain name[5], which can be
                  sinkholed by the domain name registrar, as in the case of the shutdown of the Conficker
                  botnet.[4] Some of the common detection methods for Fast Flux networks is the low TTL
                  (time to live) of the record and a high number of IPs resolved for that record.[3]
               </p>
               <p>
                  We have incorporated the C2 proxying technique without the DNS and botnet requirements
                  by utilizing open reverse tcp/http tunnels found on the internet, which provide plenty of IP
                  addresses on which we can spread our C2 comms and provide anonymity as the real C2
                  server is hidden behind the reverse proxy. In our most recent internet-wide survey we found
                  more than 1.5K servers that could be abused for this purpose
               </p>
               <h6>Multifronting</h6>
               <p>Domain fronting (ATT&CK T1090.004) is a widely used technique for evading network
                  detection. This technique hides the trojan’s HTTP requests to the C2 as if it was directed to
                  another domain hosted on the same Content Delivery Network (CDN) as the attacker’s.
                  Without TLS inspection, where a mismatch between TLS’s SNI and the HTTP header could be
                  detected, it becomes very hard for the defenders to detect malicious traffic using this
                  technique, having as a last resource the detection via statistical analysis like beaconing
                  detection.
               </p>
               <p>
                  C2Centipede has the ability to utilize multiple domain fronting configurations, which are not
                  necessarily on the same CDN, this provides additional resilience in case one of the CDN
                  providers blocks the redteamer’s account.
               </p>
               <h6>Domain Generation Algorithms</h6>
               <p>We have incorporated Flubot’s algorithm for Domain Generation Algorithm (ATT&CK:
                  T1568.002). The seed, and maximum number of domains generated are easily configurable.
               </p>
               <h6>Dynamic Proxy Configuration</h6>
               <p>C2Centipede’s configuration on the server and client can be modified on the fly by the
                  operator. The original trojan’s and C2 messages are wrapped in the tool’s own HTTP
                  messages along with the configuration changes of the routing, jitter and encryption settings
                  for the c2centipede client and server. These are piggybacked on the original HTTP requests,
                  requiring no additional “noise” in the network.
               </p>
               <h6>Limitations</h6>
               <p>The tool currently works with reverse HTTP shells that close the TCP connections (eg.
                  Metasploit, Empire) and currently does not support those with long connections (eg.
                  PoshC2, Koadic)
