               <h2> Frank Duff</h2>
               <p class="job">Chief Innovation Officer at Tidal Cyber</p>
               <p class="drop-cap"> 
                  Frank Duff is a distinguished thought leader in threat-informed defense,
                  specializing in the assessment of organizations and security capabilities. Prior to Tidal,
                  Frank spent his entire 18-year professional career at The MITRE Corporation in a variety
                  of roles.</br>
                  Frank is most well-known as the General Manager of MITRE ATT&CK® Evaluations where
                  he conceptualized, stood up, and oversaw the program. He spent the early years of
                  ATT&CK on the front lines, transitioning it to the private sector, working with solution
                  providers to understand the importance of the burgeoning knowledge base, as well as
                  advising in its integration into their products and workflows. </br>Recognizing a gap in current
                  evaluation processes, he devised a threat-informed evaluation methodology that would
                  leverage ATT&CK as the common language and would revolutionize how solution
                  provider testing was performed. He oversaw nearly 100 evaluations, including over 90%
                  of Forrester and Gartner endpoint security analyzes.
                 </p>
         </div>
		 
		 <div class="col-twelve tab-full">
		 <p> Prior to ATT&CK Evaluations, Frank helped advance the concept of post-exploit detection
                  by exploring the benefits of host-based data, on the project that inspired the creation of
                  the ATT&CK knowledge base. Needing a way to provably and repeatably measure
                  progress, he then transitioned to managing red teamers where he advanced the
                  concepts of Adversary Emulation. He also worked with a variety of government
                  customers as a specialist in growing work programs, where he worked with them to
                  embrace threat-informed defense concepts, including advancing malware analysis,
                  ATT&CK-based analytics, and purple teaming. He oversaw another 30 evaluations, across
                  a broad range of capabilities to ensure they addressed the threat, while meeting mission
                  needs.
                  </p> <p>
                  Frank started at MITRE in 2003 as an intern in Rome, NY, while obtaining his bachelor’s
                  degree in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University. After graduation, he would
                  start his full-time career in 2005. During his early years, he worked with radar data
                  processing. As he projected a change in the work program, he decided to pursue a
                  master’s degree in Computer Engineering, Information Assurance from Syracuse
                  University. He received this degree in 2008, and shortly after became the face of the
                  new local cyber work program, expanding and evolving MITRE’s presence at the site.

               </br><span style="font-size:1rem; background-color: #5b4f96; padding: 4px; margin-left:10px; color: white;"> Technical Talk </span></h3>	
               <p>
                  In MITRE ATT&CK, techniques describe the means by which adversaries achieve tactical
                  goals, sub-techniques describe the same means but a more specific level, and
                  procedures describe the variations that are precise implementations of those
                  techniques. This precision in many ways is what enables adversary emulation, and makes
                  it, well, emulation. It allows us to confidently and accurately call something “in the spirit
                  of APT29”. In many cases, in an effort to try to be precise, we narrow the focus of our
                  evaluations and only implement the limited procedures an adversary is known to
                  perform.
                  But what happens if procedural information is not available for a specific adversary? We
                  have to make an assumption about them. We do our best to get in their mindset. We
                  consider what we believe to be their end goals, but in the end, we are left with a couple
                  choices. We can make an educated guess, but in this case we fall into the same trapping
                  of above - a narrowed focus that might not even be accurate. The alternate is to
                  implement a variety of procedures and hope that we effectively cover our bases.
                  </p> <p>
                  Procedural variation looks at a single technique or sub-technique, and implements them
                  in different ways, ideally to trigger different data sources, and thus potentially different
                  defensive capabilities. It is for this reason that over the past year, there has been an
                  increased awareness and advocacy for procedural variation. Procedural variation gives
                  us greater confidence that when we say we have a defensive for the technique under
                  test, the defense will actually work.
                  Procedural variation comes with its own challenges; increased development costs and
                  potentially reducing the accuracy of our emulations are only the start of that
                  conversation. So how do we balance the benefits of procedure variation with the
                  challenges? In this talk, we will present the key considerations to make when designing
                  your ATT&CK test plans so that you can maximize your test plan’s bang-for-the-buck,
                  gaining the key confidence that procedural variation offers while staying true to threat
                  intelligence, and doing all of this while keeping budget in the back of our minds.
